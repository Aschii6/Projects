## Bachelor's Thesis
***Spoiler detection, a solution refined for specific titles***

*ABSTRACT:* <br>
Spoiler content in online discussions, reviews, or anywhere else on the internet
can have a negative impact on the experience of some people, ruining their enjoyment with the possibility of affecting the commercialisation of creative works. This
thesis aims to address the challenge of automatically detecting spoilers in text content, with a focus on online reviews, by exploring varying machine learning methods, as well as to offer a resolution in the form of an application for everyday use.

The research begins with a comparative study of well-established methods from
existing literature applied to spoiler classification, i.e. Support Vector Machines,
Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, transformer-based
models, and Graph Neural Networks. A series of experiments are conducted to
compare the approaches in these papers and present a new study on their effectiveness. Further experiments attempt to fine-tune models on distinct movie titles,
offering a solution meant to excel at detecting spoilers related to their respective title; experiments which, as far as the literature reviewed to date suggests, have yet
to be attempted.

To offer some practicality to the solution produced by the research, a Google
Chrome browser extension was developed to hide textual content from the body of
webpages, using the tools offered from Google, mainly the Chrome API. With the
content of webpages being exposed by the said API, the task of predicting spoilers
is managed by a specialised spoiler prediction API server, with which the extension
communicates.

## Software
**Farming Assistant:** https://github.com/Cozma-Alex/Frontend-Farming-Assistant
> Flutter, Dart

University Project where a team of 10 students worked for a full semester, for the course Collective Project. Alongside 2 other colleagues, I worked on Front End, where I contributed to all Task related pages, a weather widget that uses and API from OpenWeather and more...

**Outdoor Sustenabil**
> Flutter, Dart

My internship project at CS InnoHub (an organization that is part of UBB), where I worked alongside 4 other students and a mentor to develop an application meant to keep track and alert users of the presence of bears nearby, a project made for The Faculty of Environmental Science and Engineering.

**Compiler:** https://github.com/Aschii6/Compiler
> Lexical and syntax analysis in Java for a subset language of C++ and using Flex + Bison to generate Assembly Code

This project is related to an university course, but with new improvements and better design choices.

**Triathlon Management in Java:**
> Java, JavaFX, Sqlite, networking using RPC Protocol and Protobuf, ORM, REST services, React

## Some games
### Made using SFML (a low level C++ library)

**Platformer Game:** https://github.com/Aschii6/Platformer
> C++, SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library), ECS (Entities Components Systems), Scene Management

I made heavy use of the Entity Component Template to abstract some features away from the Entities, e.g. Rendering, Physics Processes.

**Vampire Survivors Copy:** https://github.com/Aschii6/Vampire-Survivors-Copy
> C++, SFML, Animations, Assest Management

### Made using Godot (a game engine)
